          <h2>About EtiBoi</h2>
          <p>
           The name is EtiBoi, a trilingual, Franco-Latino visual artist based in Los Angeles currently studying at the California Institute of the Arts. Born in Provence, France, EtiBoi has traveled the world extensively, spending most of his childhood between Africa, Asia, Andalucia and Barcelona, where he lived in close proximity to the work of inspiring artists like Gaudi, Dali, Picasso and Botero. Prior to moving to the US, he studied in the mecca of the Art World, Paris, where he took the first steps down his artistic path. EtiBoi’s work consists of distinctive characters interacting with their elaborate and meaningful settings, incorporating an array of styles and textures to create representational surrealistic pieces. Capturing a specific moment of the hero’s journey, his artwork is created through his unique lens, shaped by the array of diverse cultures of his upbringing. His objective is to merge the two mediums of film and painting.
